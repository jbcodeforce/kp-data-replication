Mirror Maker 2.0 Mirror Maker 2.0 is the new replication feature of Kafka 2.4. It was defined as part of the KIP 382 . General concepts As Mirror maker 2.0 is using kafka Connect framework, we recommend to review our summary in this note . The figure below illustrates the mirror maker internal components running within Kafka Connect. In distributed mode, Mirror Maker creates the following topics to the target cluster: mm2-configs.source.internal: This topic will store the connector and task configurations. mm2-offsets.source.internal: This topic is used to store offsets for Kafka Connect. mm2-status.source.internal: This topic will store status updates of connectors and tasks. source.heartbeats source.checkpoints.internal A typical mirror maker configuration is done via property file and defines source and target clusters with their connection properties and the replication flow definitions. Here is a simple example for a local cluster to a target cluster using TLS v1.2 for connection encryption and Sasl authentication protocol to connect to Event Streams. clusters = source, target source.bootstrap.servers = ${KAFKA_SOURCE_BROKERS} target.bootstrap.servers = ${KAFKA_TARGET_BROKERS} target.security.protocol = SASL_SSL target.ssl.protocol = TLSv1.2 target.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm = https target.sasl.mechanism = PLAIN target.sasl.jaas.config = org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\"token\" password=${KAFKA_TARGET_APIKEY}; # enable and configure individual replication flows source->target.enabled = true source->target.topics = products tasks.max = 10 White listed topics are set with the source->target.topics attribute of the replication flow and uses Java regular expression syntax. Blacklisted topics: by default the following pattern is applied: blacklist = [follower\\.replication\\.throttled\\.replicas, leader\\.replication\\.throttled\\.replicas, message\\.timestamp\\.difference\\.max\\.ms, message\\.timestamp\\.type, unclean\\.leader\\.election\\.enable, min\\.insync\\.replicas] But we can also define the samethings with the properties: topics.blacklist . Comma-separated lists are also supported and Java regular expression. Internally MirrorSourceConnector and MirrorCheckpointConnector will create multiple tasks (up to tasks.max property), MirrorHeartbeatConnector creates only one single task. MirrorSourceConnector will have one task per topic-partition to replicate, while MirrorCheckpointConnector will have one task per consumer group. The Kafka connect framework uses the coordinator API, with the assign() API, so there is no consumer group while fetching data from source topic. There is no call to commit() neither: the rebalancing occurs only when there is a new topic created that matches the whitelist pattern. Requirements to address Environments We propose two approaches to run the 'on-premise' Kafka cluster: Docker compose using vanilla Kafka 2.4 : To run local cluster we use docker-compose and docker. The docker compose file to start a local 3 Kafka brokers and 2 Zookeepers cluster is in mirror-maker-2/local-cluster folder. This compose file uses a local docker network called kafkanet . The docker image used for Kafka is coming from Strimzi open source project and is for the Kafka 2.4 version. We are describing how to setup this simple cluster using Docker compose in this article . Kafka 2.4 cluster using Strimzi operator deployed on Openshift For the Event Streams on Cloud cluster, we recommend to create your own using IBM Cloud Account. The product documentation is here . The enviroments can be summarized in the table below: Environment Source Target Connect 1 Local Event Streams on Cloud Local 2 Strimzi on OCP Event Streams on Cloud OCP / Roks 3 Event Streams on Cloud Local Local 4 Event Streams on Cloud Strimzi on OCP OCP/ Roks 5 Event Streams on OCP Event Streams on Cloud OCP / Roks Local cluster to Event Streams on Cloud The goal is to demonstrate the replicate data from local cluster to Event Streams on IBM Cloud running as managed service. The two scenarios and the step by step approach are presented in this note . We have documented the replication from Event Streams as a Service to local cluster in this note with two scenarios depending of the target Kafka cluster (running on OpenShift or on VM / containers). Provisioning Connectors (Mirror Maker 2) This main epic is related to provisioning operation. As a SRE I want to provision and deploy Mirror Maker 2 connector to existing Openshift cluster without exposing password and keys so replication can start working. This will use Kubernetes secrets for configuration parameters. We are describing the MM2 deployment with secrets in this section . As a SRE I want to understand the CLI commands used to assess to assess how the provisioning process can be automated. We did not proof how to automate the deployment, but as all deployments are done with CLI and configuration files we could consider using Ansible for automation. As a SRE I want to understand the server sizing for the Mirror Maker environment so that I can understand how to use leanest resources for minimal needs. We talk about capacity planning in this section and performance tests in a separate note . Note that, there is no specific user interface for mirror maker connector. Version to version migration As a SRE, I want to understand how to perform a version to version migration for the Mirror Maker 2 product so that existing streaming replication is not impacted by the upgrade. As a developer I want to deploy configuration updates to modify the topic white or black lists so that newly added topics are replicated. Security As a SRE, I want to understand how client applications authenticate to source and target clusters. As a developer I want to design Mirror Maker 2 based replication solution to support different line of businesses who should not connect to topics and data not related to their business and security scope. Those subjects are address in the security note Monitoring As a SRE, I want to get Mirror Maker 2 metrics for Prometheus so that it fits in my current metrics processing practices. The explanation to setup Prometheus metris for mirror maker 2.0 is documented in the monitoring note . As a SRE, I want to be able to add new dashboard into Grafana to visualize the Mirror Maker 2 metrics. As a SRE, I want to define rules for alert reporting and configure a Slack channel for alerting. [Removed] As a SRE, I want to get the Mirror Maker 2 logs into our Splunk logging platform. Best Practices As a developer I want to understand how Mirror Maker 2 based replication addresses the record duplication. Here is a note on records duplication . As a developer I want to design replication solution to minimize the instance of Mirror Maker or being able to scale them if I observe lag into data replication processing. Lag will be present anyway dues to the asynchronous processing, but it is possible to scale vertically and horizontally. As a developer I want to understand what are the condition for message loss. Performance tests As a developer I want to understand how to measure data latency and lag in data replication. As a SRE I want to understand current thoughput for the replication solution.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This repository includes a set of documents for best practices around data replication between two Kafka clusters.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#mirror-maker-20","text":"Mirror Maker 2.0 is the new replication feature of Kafka 2.4.

Active active cluster mirroring for inter services communication: consumers and producers are on both side and consumer or produce to their local cluster. Moving data to read only cluster as a front door to data lake, or to do cross data centers aggregation on the different event streams: Fan-in to get holistic data view. GDPR compliance to isolate data in country and geography Hybrid cloud operations to share data between on-premise cluster and managed service clusters. Topic metadata replication It is possible to disable the topic metadata replication (The configuration is ``). We do not encourage to do so. Per design topic can be added dynamically, specially when developing with Kafka Streams where intermediate topics are created, and topic configuration can be altered to increase the number of partitions. Changes to the source topic are dynamically propagated to the target avoiding maintenance nightmare. By synchronizing configuration properties, the need for rebalancing is reduced. When doing manual configuration, even if the initial topic configuration was duplicated, any dynamic changes to the topic properties are not going to be automatically propagate and the administrator needs to change the target topic. If the throughput on the source topic has increase and the number of partition was increased to support the load, then the target cluster will not have the same downstream capability which may lead to overloading (disk space or memory capavity). Also if the consumer of a partition is expecting to process the event in order within the partition, then changing the number of partition between source and target will make the ordering not valid any more. Also if the replication factor are set differently between the two clusters then the availability guarantees of the replicated data may be impacted and bad settings with broker failure will lead to data lost. Finally it is important to consider that changes to topic configuration triggers a consumer rebalance which stalls the mirroring process and creates a backlog in the pipeline and increases the end to end latency observed by the downstream application. Naming convention Mirror maker 2 prefix the name of the replicated topic with the name of the source cluster. This is an important and simple solution to avoid infinite loop when doing bi-directional mirroring. At the consumer side the subscribe() function support regular expression for topic name. So a code like: kafkaConsumer . subscribe ( \"^.*accounts\" ) will listen to all the topics in the cluster having cluster name prefix and local accounts topics. This could be useful when we want to aggregate data from different data centers / clusters. Offset management Mirror maker 2 track offset per consumer group. There are two topics created on the target cluster to manage the offset mapping between the source and target clusters and the checkpoints of the last committed offset in the source topic/partitions/consumer group. When a producer sends its record it gets the offset in the partition the record was saved. In the diagram below we have a source topic/partition A with the last write offset done by a producer to be 5, and the last read committed offset by the consumer assigned to partition 1 being 3. The last replicated offset 3 is mapped as 12 in the target partition. offset # do not match between partitions. So if the blue consumer needs to reconnect to the green target cluster it will read from the last committed offset which is 12 in this environment. This information is saved in the checkpoint topic. Offset synch are emitted at the beginning of the replication and when there is a situation which leads that the numbering sequencing diverges. For example the normal behavior is increase the offset by one 2,3,4,5,6,7 is mapped to 12,13,14,15,16,... if the write operation for offset 20 at the source is a 17 on the target then MM 2 emits a new offset synch records to the offset-synch topic. The checkpoint and offset_synch topics enable replication to be fully restored from the correct offset position on failover. Record duplication Exactly-once delivery is difficult to achieve in distributed system. In the case of Kafka producer, brokers, and consumers are working together to ensure only one message is processed end to end. With coding practice and configuration, within a unique cluster, Kafka can guarantee exactly once processing. No duplication between producer and broker, and committed read on consumer side is not reprocessed in case of consumer restarts. Cross cluster replications are traditionally based on at least once approach. Duplicates can happen when consumer task stops before committing its offset to the source topic. A restart will load records from the last committed offset which can generate duplicates. The following diagram illustrate this case: As mirror maker is a generic topic consumer, it will not participate to a read-committed process, if the topic includes duplicate messages it will propagate to the target. In the future MM2 will be able to support exactly once by using the checkpoint topic on the target cluster to keep the state of the committed offset from the consumer side, and write with an atomic transaction between the target topic and the checkpoint topic, and commit the source read offset as part of the same transaction. For consumer coding We recommend to review the producer implementation best practices and the consumer considerations . For platform sizing, the main metric to assess, is the number of partitions in the cluster to replicate. The number of partitions and number of brokers are somehow connected as getting a high number of partitions involves increasing the number of brokers. For Mirror Maker 2, as it is based on Kafka connect, there is a unique cluster and each partition mirroring is supported by a task within the JVM so the first constraint is the memory allocated to the container and the heap size.","title":"Replicaton considerations"},{"location":"consideration/#replication-considerations","text":"","title":"Replication considerations"},{"location":"consideration/#why-replicating","text":"The classical needs for replication between clusters can be bullet listed as: Disaster recovery when one secondary cluster is passive while the producer and consumers are on the active cluster in the primary data center: The following article goes over those principals.

This illustrate a Mirror Maker restarts Starting connector MirrorHeartbeatConnector and Starting task MirrorHeartbeatConnector-0 Starting connector MirrorCheckpointConnector Starting connector MirrorSourceConnector As expected, in the consumer console we can see the 5 product messages arriving to the source.topics after the replication complete. { 'bootstrap.servers' : 'kafka1:9092,kafka2:9093,kafka3:9094' , 'group.id' : 'ProductsProducer' } { 'product_id' : 'P01' , 'description' : 'Carrots' , 'target_temperature' : 4 , 'target_humidity_level' : 0 .4, 'content_type' : 1 } { 'product_id' : 'P02' , 'description' : 'Banana' , 'target_temperature' : 6 , 'target_humidity_level' : 0 .6, 'content_type' : 2 } { 'product_id' : 'P03' , 'description' : 'Salad' , 'target_temperature' : 4 , 'target_humidity_level' : 0 .4, 'content_type' : 1 } { 'product_id' : 'P04' , 'description' : 'Avocado' , 'target_temperature' : 6 , 'target_humidity_level' : 0 .4, 'content_type' : 1 } { 'product_id' : 'P05' , 'description' : 'Tomato' , 'target_temperature' : 4 , 'target_humidity_level' : 0 .4, 'content_type' : 2 } Scenario 2: Run Mirror Maker 2 Cluster close to target cluster This scenario is similar to the scenario 1 but Mirror Maker 2.0 now, runs within an OpenShift cluster in the same data center as Event Streams cluster, so closer to the target cluster: We have created an Event Streams cluster on Washington DC data center. We have Strimzi operators deployed in Washington data center OpenShift Cluster (see this note to provision such environment). Producers are running locally on the same OpenShift cluster, where vanilla Kafka 2.4 is running, or can run remotely using exposed Kafka brokers Openshift route. The black rectangles in the figure above represent those producers. The goal is to replicate the products topic from the left to the source.products to the right. What needs to be done: Get a OpenShift cluster in the same data center as Event Streams service: See this product introduction . It is used to deploy Mirror Maker 2, but for our test we use it as source cluster for replication too. Get the API KEY with manager role for event streams cluster and define a kubernetes secret: Run Mirror Maker 2 with the configuration as define in the file: ``. See next section for starting the MME or, read also some mirror maker 2 deployment details in this provisioning note . Start consumer on source.products topic Run a producer to source topic named products Run mirror maker 2 Create a topic to the target cluster: mm2-offset-syncs.kafka-on-premise-cluster.internal oc apply -f local-cluster/kafka-to-es-mm2.yml A new pod is created or if you have an existing mirror maker 2 depoyed the new configuration is added to your cluster. Run Consumer To validate the replication works, we will connect a consumer to the source.products topic on Event Streams. So we define a target cluster property file ( eventstreams.properties ) like: security.protocol = SASL_SSL ssl.protocol = TLSv1.2 sasl.mechanism = PLAIN sasl.jaas.config = org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\"token\" password=\"am_...\"; Start the consumer on source.products topic running in Event Streams on the cloud: we use a setenv.sh shell to export the needed environment variables docker run -ti -v $( pwd ) :/home strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.4.0 bash bash-4.2$ source /home/setenv.sh bash-4.2$ ./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server $KAFKA_TARGET_BROKERS --consumer.config /home/mirror-maker-2/eventstream.properties --topic source.products --from-beginning Produce records to local cluster Start a producer to send product records to the source Kafka cluster.

Using Strimzi operator to deploy on Kubernetes To run MM2 on a VM or as docker image which can be adapted with your own configuration, like for example by adding prometheus JMX Exporter as java agent. We are using the configuration to deploy from event streams on Cloud to a local Kafka cluster we deployed using Strimzi. Common configuration When we need to create Kubernetes secrets to manage APIKEY to access Event Streams, and TLS certificate to access local Kafka brokers, we need to do the following steps: Create a project in OpenShift to deploy Mirror Maker cluster, for example: oc new-project <projectname> . Create a secret for the API KEY of the Event Streams cluster: oc create secret generic es-api-secret --from-literal=password=<replace-with-event-streams-apikey> As your vanilla Kafka source cluster may use TLS to communicate between clients and brokers, you need to use the k8s secret defined when deploying Kafka which includes the CAroot and generic client certificates.

Deploying using Strimzi Mirror Maker operator We assume you have an existing namespace or project to deploy Mirror Maker. You also need to get the latest (0.17-rc4 at least) Strimzi configuration from the download page .

If we need to add parallel processing because of the topics to replicate have multiple partitions, or there are a lot of topics to replicate, then adding pods will help to scale horizontally. The pods are in the same consumer group, so Kafka Brokers will do the partition rebalancing among those new added consumers. Now with this deployment we can test consumer and producer as described in the scenario 4 . Deploying a custom Mirror Maker docker image We want to use custom docker image when we want to add Prometheus JMX exporter as Java Agent so we can monitor MM2 with Prometheus. The proposed docker file is in this folder and may look like: FROM strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.4.0 # ... ENV LOG_DIR = /tmp/logs ENV EXTRA_ARGS = \"-javaagent:/usr/local/share/jars/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar=9400:/etc/jmx_exporter/jmx_exporter.yaml \" # .... EXPOSE 9400 CMD /opt/kafka/bin/connect-mirror-maker.sh /home/mm2.properties As the mirror maker 2 is using properties file, we want to define source and target cluster and the security settings for both clusters. As the goal is to run within the same OpenShift cluster as Kafka, the broker list for the source matches the URL within the broker service: # get the service URL oc describe svc my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap # URL my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 The target cluster uses the bootstrap servers from the Event Streams Credentials, and the API KEY is defined with the manager role, so mirror maker can create topic dynamically. Properties template file can be seen here: kafka-to-es-mm2 clusters = source, target source.bootstrap.servers = eda-demo-24-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 source.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm = target.bootstrap.servers = broker-3-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-1-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-0-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-5-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-2-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-4-h6s2xk6b2t77g4p1.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093 target.security.protocol = SASL_SSL target.ssl.protocol = TLSv1.2 target.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm = https target.sasl.mechanism = PLAIN target.sasl.jaas.config = org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username = \"token\" password=\"<Manager API KEY from Event Streams>\"; # enable and configure individual replication flows source->target.enabled = true sync.topic.acls.enabled = false replication.factor = 3 internal.topic.replication.factor = 3 refresh.topics.interval.seconds = 10 refresh.groups.interval.seconds = 10 source->target.topics = products tasks.max = 10 Upload the properties as a secret oc create secret generic mm2-std-properties --from-file = es-cluster/mm2.properties The file could be copied inside the docker image or better mounted from a secret when deployed to kubernetes. Build and push the image to a docker registry. docker build -t ibmcase/mm2ocp:v0.0.2 . docker push ibmcase/mm2ocp:v0.0.2 Then using a deployment configuration like this one , we can deploy our custom mirror maker 2 with: oc apply -f mm2-deployment.yaml # to assess the cluster oc get kafkamirrormaker2 NAME DESIRED REPLICAS mm2-cluster 1 Define the monitoring rules As explained in the monitoring note , we need to define the Prometheus rules within a yaml file so that Mirror Maker 2 can report metrics: lowercaseOutputName : true lowercaseOutputLabelNames : true rules : - pattern : \"kafka.connect<type=connect-worker-metrics>([^:]+):\" name : \"kafka_connect_connect_worker_metrics_$1\" - pattern : \"kafka.connect<type=connect-metrics, client-id=([^:]+)><>([^:]+)\" name : \"kafka_connect_connect_metrics_$1_$2\" # Rules below match the Kafka Connect/MirrorMaker MBeans in the jconsole order # Worker task states - pattern : kafka.connect<type=connect-worker-metrics, connector=(\\w+)><>(connector-destroyed-task-count|connector-failed-task-count|connector-paused-task-count|connector-running-task-count|connector-total-task-count|connector-unassigned-task-count) name : connect_worker_metrics_$1_$2 # Task metrics - pattern : kafka.connect<type=connector-task-metrics, connector=(\\w+), task=(\\d+)><>(batch-size-avg|batch-size-max|offset-commit-avg-time-ms|offset-commit-failure-percentage|offset-commit-max-time-ms|offset-commit-success-percentage|running-ratio) name : connect_connector_task_metrics_$1_$3 labels : task : \"$2\" # Source task metrics - pattern : kafka.connect<type=source-task-metrics, connector=(\\w+), task=(\\d+)><>(source-record-active-count|source-record-poll-total|source-record-write-total) name : connect_source_task_metrics_$1_$3 labels : task : \"$2\" # Task errors - pattern : kafka.connect<type=task-error-metrics, connector=(\\w+), task=(\\d+)><>(total-record-errors|total-record-failures|total-records-skipped|total-retries) name : connect_task_error_metrics_$1_$3 labels : task : \"$2\" # CheckpointConnector metrics - pattern : kafka.connect.mirror<type=MirrorCheckpointConnector, source=(.+), target=(.+), group=(.+), topic=(.+), partition=(\\d+)><>(checkpoint-latency-ms) name : connect_mirror_mirrorcheckpointconnector_$6 labels : source : \"$1\" target : \"$2\" group : \"$3\" topic : \"$4\" partition : \"$5\" # SourceConnector metrics - pattern : kafka.connect.mirror<type=MirrorSourceConnector, target=(.+), topic=(.+), partition=(\\d+)><>(byte-rate|byte-count|record-age-ms|record-rate|record-count|replication-latency-ms) name : connect_mirror_mirrorsourceconnector_$4 labels : target : \"$1\" topic : \"$2\" partition : \"$3\" Then upload this yaml file in a secret (the following command, represents a trick to update an existing configmap) oc create secret generic mm2-jmx-exporter --from-file = ./mm2-jmx-exporter.yaml Deploying on VM On virtual machine, it is possible to deploy the Apache Kafka 2.4+ binary file and then use the command /opt/kafka/bin/connect-mirror-maker.sh with the good properties file as argument. Within a VM we can run multiple mirror maker instances. When needed we can add more VMs to scale horizontally. Each mirror makers workers are part of the same consumer groups, so it is possible to scale at the limit of the topic partition number. Capacity planning We need to address some characteristic of the Kafka Connect framework: For each topic/partition there will be a task running. We can see in the trace that tasks are mapped to threads inside the JVM. So the parallelism will be bound by the number of CPUs the JVM runs on. The parameters max.tasks specifies the max parallel processing we can have per JVM. So for each JVM we need to assess the number of partitions to be replicated. Each task is using the consumer API and is part of the same consumer group, the partition within a group are balanced by an internal controler. With Kafka connect any changes to the topic topology triggers a partition rebalancing. In MM2 each consumer / task is assigned a partition by the controller. So the rebalancing is done internally. Still adding a broker node into the cluster will generate rebalancing. The task processing is stateless, consume - produce wait for acknowledge, commit offet. In this case the CPU and network are key. For platform tuning activity we need to monitor operating system performance metrics. If the CPU becomes the bottleneck, we can allocate more CPU or start to scale horizontally by adding mirror maker 2 instance. If the network at the server level is the bottleneck, then adding more servers will help. Kafka will automatically balance the load among all the tasks running on all the machines. The size of the message impacts also the throughtput as with small message the throughput is CPU bounded. With 100 bytes messages or more we can observe network saturation. The parameters to consider for sizing are the following: Parameter Description Impact Number of topic/ partition Each task processes one partition For pure parallel processing max.tasks is the number of CPU Record size Size of the message in each partition in average Memory usage and Throughput: the # of records/s descrease when size increase, while MB/s throughput increases in logarithmic Expected input throughput The producer writing to the source topic throughput Be sure the consumers inside MM2 absorb the demand Network latency This is where positioning MM2 close to the target cluster may help improve latency Deploying Mirror Maker 2 on its own project In this section we address another approach to, deploy a Kafka Connect cluster with Mirror Maker 2.0 connectors but without any local Kafka Cluster. The approach may be used with Event Streams on Cloud as backend Kafka cluster and Mirror Maker 2 for replication. Using the Strimzi operator we need to define a Yaml file for the connector and white and black lists for the topics to replicate. Here is an example of such descriptor . If we need to run a custom Mirror Maker 2, we have documented in the section above on how to use Dockerfile and properties file and deployment descriptor to do the deployment on kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Provisioning automation For IT operation automation we can use Ansible to define a playbook to provision the Mirror Maker 2 environment. The Strimzi Ansible playbook repository containts playbook examples for creating cluster roles and service accounts and deploy operators. The automation approach will include: Deploy all cluster objects needed into a OpenShift cluster: Cluster Roles, Strimzi CRDs: Kafka, KafkaTopic, KafkaUser, Kafka connect, mirror maker(s). Deploy all namespaced objects needed into an OpenShift namespace: Service Accounts, Cluster Role Bindings and Role Bindings, Cluster Operator deployment. Deploy the kafka cluster if needed. Deploy the different mirror maker 2 instances. Typical errors in Mirror Maker 2 traces Plugin class loader for connector: 'org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorCheckpointConnector' was not found. This error message is a light issue in kafka 2.4 and does not impact the replication. In Kafka 2.5 this message is for DEBUG logs. Error while fetching metadata with correlation id 2314 : {source.heartbeats=UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION}: Those messages may come from multiple reasons. One is that the named topic is not created. In Event Streams is the target cluster the topics may need to be created via CLI or User Interface. It can also being related to the fact the consumer polls on a topic that has just been created and the leader for this topic-partition is not yet available, you are in the middle of a leadership election. The advertised listener may not be set or found.

We can see in the trace that tasks are mapped to threads inside the JVM. So the parallelism will be bound by the number of CPUs the JVM runs on. The parameters max.tasks specifies the max parallel processing we can have per JVM. So for each JVM we need to assess the number of partitions to be replicated. Each task is using the consumer API and is part of the same consumer group, the partition within a group are balanced by an internal controler. With Kafka connect any changes to the topic topology triggers a partition rebalancing. In MM2 each consumer / task is assigned a partition by the controller. So the rebalancing is done internally. Still adding a broker node into the cluster will generate rebalancing. The task processing is stateless, consume - produce wait for acknowledge, commit offet. In this case the CPU and network are key. For platform tuning activity we need to monitor operating system performance metrics. If the CPU becomes the bottleneck, we can allocate more CPU or start to scale horizontally by adding mirror maker 2 instance. If the network at the server level is the bottleneck, then adding more servers will help. Kafka will automatically balance the load among all the tasks running on all the machines. The size of the message impacts also the throughtput as with small message the throughput is CPU bounded. With 100 bytes messages or more we can observe network saturation. The parameters to consider for sizing are the following: Parameter Description Impact Number of topic/ partition Each task processes one partition For pure parallel processing max.tasks is the number of CPU Record size Size of the message in each partition in average Memory usage and Throughput: the # of records/s descrease when size increase, while MB/s throughput increases in logarithmic Expected input throughput The producer writing to the source topic throughput Be sure the consumers inside MM2 absorb the demand Network latency This is where positioning MM2 close to the target cluster may help improve latency","title":"Capacity planning"},{"location":"mm2-provisioning/#deploying-mirror-maker-2-on-its-own-project","text":"In this section we address another approach to, deploy a Kafka Connect cluster with Mirror Maker 2.0 connectors but without any local Kafka Cluster.

Prometheus is an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that, with Kubernetes, is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It can monitor multiple workloads but is normally used with container workloads. The following figure presents the prometheus generic architecture as described from the product main website. Basically the Prometheus server hosts jobs to poll HTTP end points to get metrics from the components to monitor. It supports queries in the format of PromQL , that product like Grafana can use to present nice dashboards, and it can push alerts to different channels when some metrics behave unexpectedly. In the context of data replication between kafka clusters, we want to monitor the mirror maker 2.0 metrics like the worker task states, source task metrics, task errors,... The following figure illustrates the components involved: The source Kafka cluster, the Mirror Maker 2.0 cluster, which is based on Kafka Connect, the Prometheus server and the Grafana. As all those components run on kubernetes, most of them could be deployed via Operators using Custom Resource Definitions. To support this monitoring we need to do the following steps: Add metrics configuration to your Mirror Maker 2.0 cluster Package the mirror maker 2 to use JMX Exporter as Java agent so it exposes JMX MBeans as metrics accessibles via HTTP. Deploy Prometheus using Operator Optionally deploy Prometheus Alertmanager Deploy Grafana and configure dashboard Installation and configuration Prometheus deployment inside Kubernetes uses operator as defined in the coreos github . The CRDs define a set of resources: the ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and PrometheusRule. Inside the Strimzi github repository , we can get a prometheus.yml file to deploy prometheus server using the Prometheus operator . This configuration defines, ClusterRole, ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding, and the Prometheus resource instance. We have defined our own configuration in this file . For your own deployment you have to change the target namespace, and the rules You need to deploy Prometheus and all the other elements inside the same namespace or OpenShift project as the Kafka Cluster or the Mirror Maker 2 Cluster. To be able to monitor your own on-premise Kafka cluster, you need to enable Prometheus metrics. An example of Kafka cluster Strimzi based deployment with Prometheus setting can be found in our kafka cluster definition . The declarations are under the metrics stanza and define the rules for exposing the Kafka core features. Install Prometheus Operator We recommend reading Prometheus operator product documentation. At a glance the Prometheus operator deploy and manage a prometheus server and watches new pods to monitor when they are scheduled within k8s. Source: prometheus-operator architecture After creating a namespace or reusing the Kafka cluster namespace, you need to deploy the Prometheus operator and the related service account, cluster role, role binding... We have reuse the monitoring/install/bundle.yaml from Prometheus operator github, but doing updates with a namespace sets for our project (e.g jb-kafka-strimzi ) and renaming the cluster role and binding from 'prometheus-operator' to 'prometheus-operator-strimzi` to avoid role conflict with existing prometheus deployment on OpenShift, as those roles are at the cluster level. Once done we deploy all those components: oc apply -f bundle.yaml # Authorise the prometheus-operator to do cluster work oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user prometheus-operator --serviceaccount prometheus-operator -n eda-strimzi-kafka24 When you apply those configurations, the following resources are visibles: Resource Description ClusterRole RBAC role for cluster-scoped resources. To grant permissions to Prometheus to read the health endpoints exposed by the Kafka and ZooKeeper pods, cAdvisor and the kubelet for container metrics. ServiceAccount For the Prometheus pods to run under. A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. ClusterRoleBinding To bind the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount. Deployment To manage the Prometheus Operator pod. ServiceMonitor To define the service to monitor with the Prometheus pod. Prometheus To manage the configuration of the Prometheus pod.

Validate the topic replication Objective Determine if MirrorMaker 2 can successfully replicate messages from a topic with n partitions on the source Kakfa cluster to a topic with n-m partitions on the target Kafka cluster. Given If given Manager rights on Event Streams, where Event Streams is the target Kafka cluster, MirrorMaker 2 will either create the target topic with n partitions or increase the number of partitions on the topic to n. Both of these default behaviours are proven. Method 1 Create new Credential on IES on Cloud with Write permission, but not Manager permissions. Reconfigure MirrorMaker 2 with the new Credential. Create a new topic on IES on Cloud with 5 partitions that corresponds to a new topic on local Kafka with 10 partitions. Test replication from the local Kafka topic to the topic on IES on IBM Cloud. Observe any errors in MirrorMaker 2 log, and validate data replicates as expected. Hypothesis Data will replicate successfully. The MirrorMaker 2 architecture uses Kafka Connect, and so simply acts as a 3 rd party consumer of topic data on the source side and writes to the topic on the target side as any other producer would.

Conclusion Method 1 Hypothesis proven - MirrorMaker 2 can replicate from a local topic with 10 partitions to a remote topic with 5 partitions. Performance tests The producer code, we used is based on the Apache Kafka producer performance tool which can read data from a file and generates n records to the source topic. We use the IBM Event Stream, wrapper on top of this tool to communicate with Event streams. This article explains how to use the tool. We have cloned this tool under the perf-test/event-streams-sample-producer folder. The tool reports test metrics like records per second, number of records sent, the megabytes per second, the average and maximum latencies, from the producer.metrics() and other stats from the tools. The arguments supported are: Argument Description --record-size value > or --payload-file filename one is mandatory but not both. Work only for UTF-8 encoded text files --topic name mandatory --num-records value mandatory --payload-delimiter char delimiter to be used when --payload-file is provided.

Strimzi uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect clusters. When the Strimzi Cluster Operator is up, it starts to watch for certain OpenShift or Kubernetes resources containing the desired Kafka and/or Kafka Connect cluster configuration. The base of strimzi is to define a set of kubernetes operators and custom resource definitions for the different elements of Kafka. We recommend to go over the product overview page . The service account and role binding do not need to be re-installed if you did it previously. Concept summary The Cluster Operator is a pod used to deploys and manages Apache Kafka clusters, Kafka Connect, Kafka MirrorMaker (1 and 2), Kafka Bridge, Kafka Exporter, and the Entity Operator. When deployed the following commands goes to the Cluster operator: # Get the current cluster list oc get kafka # get the list of topic oc get kafkatopics Example of topic can be seen in section below . Kafka User are not saved part of kafka cluster but they are managed in kubernetes. For example the user credentials are saved as secret. CRDs act as configuration instructions to describe the custom resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and are provided with Strimzi for each Kafka component used in a deployment. Strimzi Operators Deployment The deployment is done in two phases: Deploy the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which act as specifications of the custom resource to deploy. Deploy one to many instance of those CRDs In CR yaml file the kind attribute specifies the CRD to conform to. Each CRD has a common configuration like bootstrap servers, CPU resources, logging, healthchecks... The next steps are defining how to deploy a Kafka Cluster. Create a namespace or openshift project kubectl create namespace eda-strimzi-kafka24 # Or using Openshift CLI oc new-project eda-strimzi-kafka24 Download the strimzi artefacts We have already created the configuration from the source strimzi github in the following folder openshift-strimzi/eda-strimzi-kafka24/cluster-operator . So you do not need to do the following steps if you use the same project name: eda-strimzi-kafka24 . In case you want to do on your own, get the last Strimzi release from this github page . Then modify the Role binding yaml files with the namespace set in previous step. sed -i '' 's/namespace: .*/namespace: eda-strimzi-kafka24 /' $strimzi -home/install/cluster-operator/*RoleBinding*.yaml Deploy the Custom Resource Definitions for kafka Custom resource definitions are defined within the kubernetes cluster. The following commands oc apply -f openshift-strimzi/eda-strimzi-kafka24/cluster-operator/ oc get crd In case of Strimzi cluster operator fails with error like: \" kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:eda-strimzi-kafka24 :strimzi-cluster-operator\" cannot watch resource \"kafkas\" in API group \"kafka.strimzi.io\" in the namespace \"eda-strimzi-kafka24 \", you need to add cluster role to the strimzi operator user by doing the following commands: oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced --serviceaccount strimzi-cluster-operator -n eda-strimzi-kafka24 oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user strimzi-entity-operator --serviceaccount strimzi-cluster-operator -n eda-strimzi-kafka24 The commands above, should create the following service account, resource definitions, roles, and role bindings: Names Resource Command strimzi-cluster-operator A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. oc get sa -l app=strimzi strimzi-cluster-operator-global, strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced, strimzi-entity-operator, strimzi-kafka-broker, strimzi-topic-operator Cluster Roles oc get clusterrole strimzi-cluster-operator-entity-operator-delegation, strimzi-cluster-operator, strimzi-cluster-operator-topic-operator-delegation Role binding oc get rolebinding strimzi-cluster-operator, strimzi-cluster-operator-kafka-broker-delegation Cluster Role Binding oc get clusterrolebinding -l app=strimzi kafkabridges, kafkaconnectors, kafkaconnects, kafkamirrormaker2s kafka, kafkatopics, kafkausers Custom Resource Definitions oc get customresourcedefinition Note All those resources are labelled with strimzi name. Add Strimzi Admin Role If you want to allow non-kubernetes cluster administators to manage Strimzi resources, you must assign them to the Strimzi Administrator role. First deploy the role definition using the following command: oc apply -f openshift-strimzi/eda-strimzi-kafka24/010-ClusterRole-strimzi-admin.yaml Then assign the strimzi-admin ClusterRole to one or more existing users in the Kubernetes cluster. kubectl create clusterrolebinding strimzi-admin --clusterrole=strimzi-admin --user=<user-your-username-here> Deploy instances Deploy Kafka cluster The CRD for kafka cluster resource is here and we recommend to study it before defining your own cluster. Change the name of the cluster in one the yaml in the examples/kafka folder or use our openshift-strimzi/kafka-cluster.yml file in this project as a starting point. This file defines the default replication factor of 3 and in-synch replicas of 2. For development purpose we will accept plain (unencrypted) listener on port 9092 without TLS authentication. For external to the kubernetes cluster access we need to have external listeners. For Openshift, as we use routes, we need to add the external.type = route . When exposing Kafka using OpenShift Routes and the HAProxy router, a dedicated Route is created for every Kafka broker pod. An additional Route is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address. Kafka clients can use these Routes to connect to Kafka on port 443. Even for development we added the metrics rules in the metrics stamza within kafka-cluster.yml file to expose kafka and zookeeper metrics for tool like Prometheus. For production we need to use persistence for the kafka log, ingress or load balancer external listener and rack awareness policies.
